ErrorAnalysisToolkit
====================

Tools to examine image registration and tracking errors.

The toolkit contains mostly code from my PhD, but there is some other recent example code for NDI Aurora communication set up in matlab.  It is not completely up to date, but eventually this tool kit will be able to comlete replicate my code simulations from my thesis and published papers.  This is clearly long overdue but it is still in progress.
